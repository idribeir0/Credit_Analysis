# ðŸ§  Credit Analysis

This project is a personal simulation of a credit risk analysis based on real-world business scenarios.

The idea is to create a dataset of fictitious clients with financial and behavioral variables, and explore insights that could help define their credit risk level.

The project is still in development and will include:
- Simulated client database
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Risk classification
- Simple predictive modeling
